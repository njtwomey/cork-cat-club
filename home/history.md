title: Cork Cat Club's History
left: Cork Cat Club was founded in 1970 by a Cobh lady, Mrs. Cecelia Baker. The new club became affiliated to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy of Ireland and two years later held their first Championship show. Since then the club has held annual shows throughout Cork City and County. The shows attract exhibits, both pedigree and non-pedigree from all over Ireland and the U.K. With judges travelling from France, Italy, Holland and the United Kingdom as well as Ireland to give their expert opinion on all the cats.
